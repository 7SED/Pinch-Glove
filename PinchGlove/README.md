# Pinch-Glove

PROJECT: VIRTUAL REALITY/PINCH GLOVE
YEAR: 2019
AUTHOR: SH.SEDGHI, F.DEHGHANNEZHAD

This is the main code for a pinch glove project using the MDK-ARM and STM-32F microcontroller. The code utilizes the HAL_GPIO library to read and write to the GPIO pins on the microcontroller. The code checks the status of GPIO pin 3 on the GPIOE port and if it is set to 1, it increments a counter and displays the count on the LCD screen.

This code is intended to be used as part of a larger project that utilizes the pinch gestures from the gloves to interact with a virtual environment.

Please note that this code is provided as is and may require additional modifications to work with your specific setup and hardware. Use caution and proper testing when implementing this code in your own project.
